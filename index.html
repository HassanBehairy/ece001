            <p>
                An operating system acts as an intermediary between a computer user and computer hardware. The goal of an operating system is to create a user-friendly and secure environment to execute programs.<br>
                An OS is a computer hardware management program. The hardware must provide adequate mechanisms to ensure that the computer system operates correctly and prevent the system from interfering with its proper operation by user programs.<br>

        <h3><b>Operating System</b> – Definition:</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>
                    An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application  programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.
