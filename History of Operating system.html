                <b>Operating Systems - Late 1950s</b>
                By the late 1950s Operating systems were well improved and started supporting following usages:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <Li>
                	It was able to perform Single stream batch processing.
                </Li>
                <li>
                	It could use Common, standardized, input/output routines for device access.
                </li>
                <li>
                	Program transition capabilities to reduce the overhead of starting a new job was added.
                </li>
                <li>
                	Error recovery to clean up after a job terminated abnormally was added.
                </li>
                <li>
                	Job control languages that allowed users to specify the job definition and resource requirements were made possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
